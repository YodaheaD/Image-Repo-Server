### By: Yodahea Daniel

 
### Description
This Image Repository Server is an application that manages all the images and their metadata for my repository.

### Features
The server allows users to:
- Upload images
- Delete images
- Add a date to the images
- Add notes on an image
- Add tags to images

### Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide a long-term solution for managing images while making them easily accessible and manageable.

### Details
All images are stored in an Azure Blob, and all information is stored in an Azure Table. The server is paired with the Image Repository UI application to complete the whole app.

This server is built using Node.js and Express.js written in TypeScript.

### The Frontend
The frontend part of this application can be under the `Image-Repo` repository in my GitHub account.
